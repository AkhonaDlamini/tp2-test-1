The SDLC also known as System Development Life Cycle is the foundation of all the 
processes involved in system development. We have 6 or rather 7 stages or processes involved
in SDLC namely, Planning, Analyisis, Design, Implementation, Deployment and Support.

Planning involves identifying a problem and seeking approval for example identifying that there
is a need for an online booking system for counselling.

Analyisis involves defining the system requirements like what would the system need in order
to work or why would the user need to use the system.For example what feature would I like to
see on a online booking system.

Design is all about creating models that are going to help you define the system. For example
creating a prototype for a login page.

Implementation invloves starting with developing the system now that everything has been defined
or understood. Example would be coding a login page or registration page cause now we understand
the details the user should include in it.

Deployment involves preparing for or moving the system into the user's hands to be used. For
example releasing the system so that it is tested and feedback is given.

Support is all about getting feedback and improving your system. For example a feature in your
app was not working properly.
